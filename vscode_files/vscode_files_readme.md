# README

This directory contains exported files delineating my current VS Code-Insiders settings and extensions.

The extension files were exported using the `code --list-extensions --show-versions > extensions.txt` command. The extensions can be installed using the `code --install-extension` command.

The settings are installed by copying the contents of the `settings.json` file to the `settings.json` file in the VS Code-Insiders settings directory.
